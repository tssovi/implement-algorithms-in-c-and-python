# What is Algorithm?
> Generally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.\
> Shortly we can say that, an algorithm is a detailed series of instructions for carrying out an operation or solving a problem.

# Why Algorithm is important?
> Algorithm is everything. Algorithms give the programmer the power to implement efficient, reliable, and fast code in a shorter amount of time.\
> In real life by intentionally or unintentionally we are using algorithms. Suppose you find the fastest way to go to a place or efficient way to bake a cake or solving rubik's cube in all the way we use algorithm.\
> We can say that **Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs**
